# Migration Guides

The following documents explain how to migrate your existing ABP Commercial applications. We write migration documents only if you need to take an action while upgrading your solution. Otherwise, you can easily upgrade your solution using the [abp update command](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Upgrading).

> The following guides are only for the ABP Commercial. Please also see the [ABP Framework migration guides](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Migration-Guides/Index) while upgrading your solution.
