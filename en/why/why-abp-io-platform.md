# Why ABP.IO Platform?

This document aims to answer to the big question: "Why should you use the ABP.IO Platform instead of creating your solution from scratch?"

The document introduces the challenges of building a modern software solution and explains how ABP addresses these challenges.

## Creating a New Solution

When you need to start a new solution, there are **a lot of questions** you need to ask yourself and you should spend **a lot of time** before starting to write your **very first business code**.

### Creating an Empty Solution

Even creating an almost-empty solution is challenging;

* How do you **organize your codebase** across projects?
* What are the **layers** and how they interact with each other?
* How do you **integrate** to 3rd-party library and systems?
* How to setup the automated **tests**?

ABP provides a **well-architected**, **layered** and **production-ready** [startup solution](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Startup-Templates/Application) based on the [Domain Driven Design](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design) principles. The solution also includes pre-configured **unit** and **integration** [test](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Testing) projects for each layer.

Creating such a solution structure requires a good **architectural experience** and a **significant time to prepare** it. ABP provides it in just one minute.

### Common Libraries

Which **libraries** you should use to implement **common requirements**? Software development ecosystem is highly dynamic and it is **hard to follow** the latest tools, libraries, trends and approaches.

ABP **pre-integrates** the **popular**, **mature** and **up to date libraries** into the solution. You don't spend your time to integrate them and talk to each other. They properly work out of the box.

### UI Theme

When it comes to the UI, there are a lot of challenges including to prepare a foundation to create a **responsive**, **modern** and **flexible** UI kit with a consistent look & feel and tons of features (like left/top navigation menu, header, toolbar, footer, widgets... etc).

Even if you buy a pre-built theme, **integrating** it to your solution may take **days of development**, if not weeks. Upgrading such a theme is another problem. Most of the times, the theme's HTML/CSS structure is mixed to your UI code and it is not easy to **upgrade** or **change** the theme later.

ABP Framework provides a [theming](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/UI/AspNetCore/Theming) system that makes your UI code independent from the theme. Themes are just **NuGet/NPM packages**. Installing or upgrading a theme is just a minute. While you can build your own theme (or integrate an existing theme), ABP Commercial offers **professional and modern** [themes](https://commercial.abp.io/themes).

### Coding Standards & Training

Once you create the solution that is ready for development, you typically need to **train the developers** to make them understand the system and develop it with the same **conventions** in a **standard** and consistent way.

ABP solution is already **well-defined** and **well-documented**. [Tutorials](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Tutorials/Part-1) and best practice guides clearly explains how to make development on this solution.
