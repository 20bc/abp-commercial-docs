# Microservice Startup Template Applications

> This startup template is not feature complete and well documented yet. However, we found it valuable to share with the ABP Commercial customers. That doesn't mean it is not production ready. You can start to develop your real solution today. But we will improve it and write more documentation for different development and deployment scenarios.

## Authentication Server

> The Authentication Server (named as AuthServer) is a web application that is used as the single sign-on authentication server. It hosts the public account pages such as login, register, forgot password, two factor authentication, profile management... pages, OAuth endpoints and authentication related APIs. All applications and services use this application as a central authority for the authentication.

### Authentication & Authorization

AuthServer hosts the public account pages such as login, register, forgot password etc.

### Deployment Configurations

> Since AuthServer is an application based on IdentityServer4; all the deployment requirements are also valid for AuthServer application.

#### Signing Certificate

AuthServer application uses [developer signing certificates option]([abp/AbpIdentityServerBuilderOptions.cs at dev Â· abpframework/abp (github.com)](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/blob/dev/modules/identityserver/src/Volo.Abp.IdentityServer.Domain/Volo/Abp/IdentityServer/AbpIdentityServerBuilderOptions.cs#L29)) for default development environment. Using developer signing certificates may cause *IDX10501: Signature validation failed* error. 

To change the signing credential for staging/production, update your application module with IIdentityServerBuilder pre-configuration.

```csharp
public override void PreConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
	PreConfigure<IIdentityServerBuilder>(builder =>
	{
    	builder.AddSigningCredential(...);	
	});
}
```

#### Running AuthServer on HTTPS

AuthServer must be publicly reachable and available over https. [Microsoft recommendation for enforcing https](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio#require-https) is using **Https** and **Hsts** together for https redirection;

```csharp
public override void OnApplicationInitialization(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
{
    var app = context.GetApplicationBuilder();
    var env = context.GetEnvironment();
    ...
    if (!env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseErrorPage();
        app.UseHsts();
    }
    
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();    
    app.UseCors(DefaultCorsPolicyName);
    ...
}
```

#### Running AuthServer Behind Load Balancer


Configure *Forewarded Headers* when running AuthServer behind Load Balancers;

```csharp
 public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
 {
     var hostingEnvironment = context.Services.GetHostingEnvironment();
     var configuration = context.Services.GetConfiguration();
     ...
     context.Services.Configure<ForwardedHeadersOptions>(options =>
     {
         options.ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto;
     });
 }
public override void OnApplicationInitialization(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
{
    var app = context.GetApplicationBuilder();
    var env = context.GetEnvironment();
    ...
    if (!env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseErrorPage();          
	    app.UseForwardedHeaders();
        app.UseHsts();
    }
    
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();    
    app.UseCors(DefaultCorsPolicyName);
    ...
}
```

#### Running AuthServer on Kubernates Pods

You may not be able to set certificates in pods and have to use http inside pods. In this case, use midware for redirection to https

```csharp
public override void OnApplicationInitialization(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
{
    var app = context.GetApplicationBuilder();
    var env = context.GetEnvironment();
    ...
	if (!env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseErrorPage();
        app.UseHsts();
    }
    
    app.Use((httpContext, next) =>
    {
        httpContext.Request.Scheme = "https";
        return next();
    });
    
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();    
    app.UseCors(DefaultCorsPolicyName);
    ...
}
```

If headers are not forwarded as expected, enable logging. Check [Microsoft Troubleshoot Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer?view=aspnetcore-5.0#troubleshoot) fore more information.

### Adding Tests

AuthServer application has it's own solution under app folder. Create a **test** folder under auth-server directory.  Open **AuthServer** solution and add a new solution folder named **test**.

Add the test projects required by your needs under this folder. Check [The Test Projects Docs](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Testing) for more information.
