# Entity Action Extensions for Angular UI

## Introduction

Entity action extension system allows you to add a new action to the action menu for an entity. A "Click Me" action was added to the user management page below:

![user-action-extension-click-me](../../images/user-action-extension-click-me.png)

You can take any action (open a modal, make an HTTP API call, redirect to another page... etc) by writing your custom code. You can access to the current entity in your code.
